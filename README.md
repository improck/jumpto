JumpTo v1.0 was originally published by me for purchase on the Unity Asset Store in 2014 and was compatible with Unity 4.6. Later, v2.0 was published to add support for Unity 5.3.1p1 which introduced major changes to the way that scenes worked. As of the publication of this repository, JumpTo is henceforth being made available to the public for personal, educational, and commercial use at no cost. See the file COPYING for licensing details.

**Notice**: The JumpTo product and its source code are not to be repackaged or reformed into a _competing product_, sold, or otherwise redistributed for compensation of any kind. My intentions with this public repository is for JumpTo to become a free tool for everyone to use without fees. That said, the source code herein is being made available, and others may find parts of the code to be useful in their own products. The intention and explicit wording of the license leaves room for such usage of JumpTo's source code. If you are in doubt about usage, please just send me an email and ask.

See the Releases page for installation instructions for the currently supported versions of Unity.
