## JumpTo - A Favorites Tool for Unity, by Imp Rock ##
Drag and drop assets and scene objects to the JumpTo window to create a new link. Use that link just like the original.

### Usage ###
* Refer to the mildly outdated PDF inside the package.
* In the Unity Editor's top menu bar, Select Window/JumpTo.
* Drag in links from the Project window.
* Open scenes, drag in links from those.
* Closing JumpTo will save the Project Links to file.
* The Hierarchy Links can be saved at any time, as long as that scene is saved.
* Multi-scene editing is supported.
* Prefab-edit mode is currently not supported (as of v2.1.0).

### Notice ###
The JumpTo product and its source code are not to be repackaged or reformed into a _competing product_, sold, or otherwise redistributed for compensation of any kind. My intention is for JumpTo to remain a free tool for everyone to use without fees. That said, the source code herein is being made available, and others may find parts of the code to be useful in their own products. The intention and explicit wording of the license leaves room for such usage of JumpTo's source code. If you are in doubt about usage, please just send me an email and ask.
