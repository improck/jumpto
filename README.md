## JumpTo - A Favorites Tool for Unity, by Imp Rock ##
Drag and drop assets and scene objects to the JumpTo window to create a new link. Use that link just like the original.

### Installation ###
For the latest version, add https://github.com/improck/jumpto.git#upm to Unity's Package Manager. Or, edit the manifest.json file for your project, and add a dependency like so
```"com.improck.jumpto": "https://github.com/improck/jumpto.git#upm"```

If you need to use a particular version, reference the tag instead of #upm, e.g. https://github.com/improck/jumpto.git#2.1.0

### Usage ###
* Refer to the mildly outdated PDF inside the package.
* In the Unity Editor's top menu bar, Select Window/JumpTo.
* Drag in links from the Project window.
* Open scenes, drag in links from those.
* Closing JumpTo will save the Project Links to file.
* The Hierarchy Links can be saved at any time, as long as that scene is saved.
* Multi-scene editing is supported.
* Prefab-edit mode is currently not supported (as of v2.1.0).

### History ###
JumpTo v1.0 was originally published by me for purchase on the Unity Asset Store in 2014 and was compatible with Unity 4.6. Later, v2.0 was published to add support for Unity 5.3.1p1 which introduced major changes to the way that scenes worked. As of the publication of this repository, JumpTo is henceforth being made available to the public for personal, educational, and commercial use at no cost. See the file COPYING for licensing details.

### Notice ###
The JumpTo product and its source code are not to be repackaged or reformed into a _competing product_, sold, or otherwise redistributed for compensation of any kind. My intentions with this public repository is for JumpTo to become a free tool for everyone to use without fees. That said, the source code herein is being made available, and others may find parts of the code to be useful in their own products. The intention and explicit wording of the license leaves room for such usage of JumpTo's source code. If you are in doubt about usage, please just send me an email and ask.
